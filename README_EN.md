# Personal computer Voice Assistant


## Testing the Installation
Once youâ€™ve got PyAudio installed, you can test the installation from the console.

`python -m speech_recognition`

Make sure your default microphone is on and unmuted. If the installation worked, you should see something like this:

`A moment of silence, please...
Set minimum energy threshold to 600.4452854381937
Say something!`

Go ahead and play around with it a little bit by speaking into your microphone and seeing how well SpeechRecognition transcribes your speech.
